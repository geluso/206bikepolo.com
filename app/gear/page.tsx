            <li>So the gear on back wheel would have around 15 teeth</li>
            <ul className="ps-6 list-disc list-inside">
              <li>multiply that by 1.5 to 1.8 to get front chainring size</li>
              <li>so then the front chain ring will be around 22-27 teeth</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Smaller gears will make bike a little lighter too</li>
          </ul>

          <ul className="ps-6 list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Prevents ball from going between spokes when playin as goalie</li>
            <li>Also can prevent spokes from breaking</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Any size diameter of wheel (does not matter much)</li>
